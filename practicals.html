    <h2 id="prac01">Prac 1 - HTML (non-CMS) Web Design</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> Your task in the first prac is to make a <em>very</em> simple website for your <em>startup business</em> for assignment 1 and publish it online (submit the URL). The site should have at least 3 pages (or sections for a single-page design) and contain enough content that a reasonable person would understand your startup business; including text and images.</p>
      <p>Your assignments are to be done with a CMS, but this prac asks you to create a static website.<br> You are welcome to use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> or any other non-CMS technology, including templates/examples you find online, BUT you may NOT use a site builder like Wix, SquareSpace, Weebly... You need to write HTML yourself as that's the learning outcome here.</p>
      <p>Consider the content and design that your site would need to be able to achieve its goal... and consider what that goal is!</p>
      <h3>Publishing to Web Hosting</h3>
      <p>Part of this subject is for you to get used to evaluating, choosing and using site hosting.<br> 
        To get you started, we have arranged a <strong>ONE TIME ONLY</strong> deal with SiteGround, so you can <a href="https://www.siteground.com/studentsprogram" target="_blank">sign up for a free
                account with your JCU email now</a>. (If you have used their free offer before, you can not use it again without paying.)</p>
      <p><em>Publish</em> your simple site in a folder called <em>startup</em><br> 
        For more details on publishing to SiteGround, see their <a href="https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/" target="_blank">tutorials</a>.</p>
      <p>If you have your own laptop, now might be a good time to start getting the following installed and setup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank">PHPStorm</a> (with account from
          <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students</a>) or <a href="http://atom.io">Atom IDE</a> or whatever you prefer.
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://vagrantup.com" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> - See below for details
        </li>
        <li>Slack, Trello and their mobile apps</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac02">Prac 2 - Joomla CMS</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>If you did <em>not</em> finish last week's practical task (including uploading), then you should note that you are already <em>falling behind!</em> So you need to allocate more time between classes to do practical work.</p>
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> make a start on assignment 1 using the <a href="http://joomla.org" target="_blank">Joomla
            CMS</a>. Again, it can be very simple at this stage. Your new site should look different than a default Joomla install and look like a site for your startup, so customise/change the template and its properties and make sure you have pages/text/images for your startup.</p>
      <p>For today, you can use the 1-click Joomla installer through SiteGround and work directly on the live site online, but you need to start working towards having a local development environment and having your sites installed there.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac03">Prac 3 - WordPress CMS & Group Interviews</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> create a simple WordPress site for your startup (first assignment), either locally or hosted online; and complete the group-formation task described below.</p>
      <p>You can re-use everything from the site you made last week in Joomla, so this task is focused more on learning and using WordPress rather than developing content and design for your site.</p>
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Group formation:</strong> Soon, you will start work on your major group project, and so we need to form your groups. You are free to choose your own groups (of 4-5 people), but this week we will complete a "job interview style" exercise to try and enhance our chances of choosing well.<br>
      <strong>External students: </strong> do this via public Slack messages in #externalcp3402<br>
      <strong>Internal students: </strong> meet with everyone else in the class (round robin style) and conduct a <strong>one minute</strong> interview, taking notes.<br>
    Think about questions that could help you probe for attributes of good group members... working style, availablility, diligence, shared expectations...</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac04">Prac 4 - Local Development + Deployment</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> get a local development environment setup and be able to deploy your local sites to "production". Note that you don't have to have this totally figured out today; it will take time to experiment with different options and
        adjust your system as you learn and try new things. You need to be able to demonstrate a dynamic site with a database (either a CMS or code+DB) running on your localhost.
      </p>
      <p>If you're working on a JCU computer, your options are more limited, but you can use <a href="http://github.com/lindsaymarkward/WPDistillery">this custom version of WPDistillery vagrant</a> (or even <a href="http://usbwebserver.net/webserver" target="_blank">USB WebServer</a>)
        to run a local environment. You will need to export your work to take with you when you leave.</p>
      <p>If you have already got a local development + deployment workflow going, then continue to work on your sites according to the assignment requirements (e.g. have you got plugins/extensions installed?).</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac05">Prac 5 - WordPress Child Theme</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> using either your first assignment or another WordPress site, create a child theme with at least 6 visible customisations.</p>
      <p>If you're using VVV and the topdown dashboard, you can use it to start your new child theme. <br> Otherwise, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes" target="_blank">follow
                the developer docs</a> to create a folder inside themes with the recommended naming convention, copy or create a new style.css file (and remember to refer to the parent theme in the comment, e.g. if the parent theme were "twentysixteen",
        <code>Template: twentysixteen</code>), and create functions.php to enqueue the style file(s), as explained in class (see notes).</p>
      <p>Use your browser's <strong>inspector</strong> to make live changes, then copy these to your CSS file.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac06">Prac 6 - Group Setup</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> complete setting up all of the teamwork tools, make at least one GitHub commit (see a message in your integrated/linked Slack group), and complete your group agreement in your project board.
      </p>
      <p>Please meet in your teams to talk about your assignment 2 project team and to start getting organised:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will have been added to a private group on <strong>Slack</strong> (check this now)</li>
        <li>(everyone) Login to <strong>GitHub</strong>, then create or join your group's GitHub repo using the GitHub Classroom link provided in the assignment details.<br>
          If you are first to create the GitHub repo, then when asked for your repo name, it should be the same as your Slack group name so that it's easy to find (e.g. cp3402-2018-team01).
        </li>
        <li><em>Option: If you would prefer to use <strong><a
                    href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/">GitHub
                Projects</a></strong> instead of <strong>Trello</strong>, that is fine.</em> GitHub Projects is more suitable if you want to focus on tasks more in terms of code and issues.<br> (one person) <em>copy</em> the <a href="https://trello.com/b/07nYDApo/web-project-dev-template"
            target="_blank">Trello
                    template board</a>, <strong>make sure it is <em>public</em></strong> and add all of the other team members.
          <br>You do not need to use your Trello board in the way that this template is set out - it's just an example. How you do things is up to you, but the <strong>group agreement</strong> needs to stay on your board. Everything else is your choice.
        </li>
        <li>(one person) <strong>Integrate </strong>both your GitHub repo and Trello board with your Slack group. <br />
          <a href="https://github.com/CP1406/ProjectManagement/wiki" target="_blank">More details (including screenshots) for integrating GitHub and Trello with your Slack channel are here.</a><br> When you add an integration (GitHub, Trello Alerts),
          it might warn you that we've reached the integration limit. This is not a problem because we're just adding more instances of existing integrations. Ignore the warning (but do not add an integration for a new app).<br /> When you are integrating
          GitHub with your Slack group, type a slash command in your private group like (change last part to your GitHub repo URL)<br />
          <code>/github subscribe https://github.com/repo</code>
        </li>
        <li>(everyone) Work together to complete the <strong>Group Agreement & Contacts</strong> section of the Trello board.<br> This is how you decide on your shared team expectations, and is an important step. Don't skip through it, but think about it
          carefully. E.g. for the "skills assessment", don't just write "WordPress", but think about and describe what skills (technical and "soft") you want to contribute to the project.
        </li>
        <li>(everyone) Start doing some project planning, including assigning team members to tasks on your Trello board...
          <br>One example of a suitable task for each member to do this week would be to investigate and test different hosting platforms.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac-group">Group Project Work Pracs</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox">Part of the marks for each of the remaining practicals are for effective participation in your stand-up + work done on your project.<br>
        You should usually be able to demonstrate work by GitHub commits, and we should be able to see a history of completed work in your project board.<br />
        <strong>Note</strong> that some remaining pracs have extra requirements for individual work in addition to the group work component.</p>
      <p>In these later practicals, you will work in your project teams to develop the project assignment.
      </p>
      <p>Think of each week as a <em>sprint</em>.<br> Each of these practicals will start with a <strong>stand-up meeting</strong> for each group.<br>
        <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Business-Skills-tutorials/Having-daily-stand-up-meetings/175075/437998-4.html" target="_blank">Here is a short video about stand-ups to help everyone understand them</a>.</p>
      <p> Make sure you actually stand for your meeting! This IS what many industry teams do every single day, so this is preparing you for industry. <br> These meetings are <strong>NOT</strong> for you to present <em>to</em> the lecturer – it is for you
        to discuss your work; and the lecturer/tutor will just witness the meetings (and possibly add prompts if needed).
      </p>
      <p>Here’s how each stand-up should go. Each person tells the rest of their team:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What they worked on last week (since the last meeting)</li>
        <li>Any road-blocks or things they’re stuck on (and might need help with)</li>
        <li>What they plan to achieve in the coming week (before the next meeting)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be honest about your progress, and help each other. Discuss who is doing what, and then use your project board to assign tasks (use "members"). </p>
      <p>After your short (no more than 5 minutes) meeting, get to work, developing your project site, including working out and using your development and deployment workflow.</p>

      <p>Make sure you continue to research modern development workflows and adjust your team's workflow as you learn, and based on your experiences. You should be working with multiple <em>local</em> development environments (one per member), a
        <em>staging</em> and a <em>production</em> environment.</p>

      <p>Use <strong>GitHub</strong> to keep track of and version control your code outputs. You should probably set your repo to track your <code>wp-content</code> folder. Use a .gitignore and/or remove files that you don't need to track (like other themes).</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac07">Prac 7 - PHP (& Group Project Work)</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> write and publish PHP code to demonstrate the features below (the content of the page/site is up to you but must be original, not from some PHP tutorial).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>echoing different kinds of HTML</li>
        <li>selection - if/else statements</li>
        <li>loops - for, while, foreach (use an array)</li>
        <li>functions with parameters</li>
        <li>include - make two pages that include a common header and/or footer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may like to fork <a href="https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/theadviceshop" target="_blank">The Advice
            Shop site</a>, get it running, then update it by making a proper login system and other nice enhancements.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac09">Prac 9 - Sass (& Group Project Work)</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> demonstrate your ability to use Sass and a suitable workflow (preferably automated) for creating CSS, including the features below in a simple new website (not WordPress). The content is up to you but must be original, not from some Sass tutorial.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>variables</li>
        <li>nesting</li>
        <li>mixins</li>
        <li>extend/inheritance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note: </strong> To use Sass on the JCU Lab Macs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As the installation instructions say, you can install Sass by downloading the package for your operating&nbsp;system <a href="https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/latest">from GitHub</a> and <a href="https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/">adding it to your <code>PATH</code></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Test it like (example) <code>sass input.scss output.css</code><br>
          You can then <strong>watch</strong> for changes, like <code>sass --watch styles:styles</code> (where styles is both the input and output directory)
        </li>
        <li>
          Optional: If you like you can install a task runner like Grunt or Gulp in the Linux VM, then setup a Gruntfile (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/theadviceshop/blob/sassy/Gruntfile.js">like this one</a>) and run grunt/gulp in your VM terminal.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can then use whatever editor you want to edit your Sass code (e.g. PHPStorm on the Mac) and Grunt or the watcher will auto-update your CSS code when it detects changes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternatively, you could install Sass in a Linux VM like the one that has been customised to suit the labs: <a href="https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/WPDistillery">https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/WPDistillery</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prac-practice">Penultimate Prac - Presentation Rehearsals</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p class="notebox"><strong>Task:</strong> stand-up meeting + group rehearsal of presentation</p>
      <p>Don't worry if your presentation is not "finished" at this stage. You can start rehearsing with an unfinished plan or slide deck, and you will more readily see where your gaps are. The more you rehearse, the better you'll be.</p>
      <p>Aim to run through your presentation 3 times. After each time, discuss the areas that need improvement, then improve those and rehearse again. Use the assignment document for details of requirements and expectations. As you evaluate your group's
        practice presentations, you can "mark" them with the supplied rubric - to help identify areas to work on.</p>
      <p>Remember to plan and practise a <em>realistic demonstration</em>.</p>

      <li><strong>WordMove</strong>: a handy tool for copying (deploying) from your Vagrant localhost environment to another (staging/production) site: <a href="https://github.com/welaika/wordmove">https://github.com/welaika/wordmove</a><br> You install this
        IN Vagrant - after <code>vagrant ssh</code><br>
        <div class="notebox"><strong>Note:</strong> if you are using VVV with ruby 2.4, you need to run <code>rvm
                group add rvm "$USER"</code> then log out and back in again <em>before</em> installing wordmove.<br> If you get an error something like <code>"sql_adapter.rb:44:in `gsub!': invalid byte sequence in
                    US-ASCII"</code>, edit your <code>.profile</code> file as described in the <a href="https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/invalid-byte-sequence-in-UTF-8-while-pushing---pulling-db">Wordmove
